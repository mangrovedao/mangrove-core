This package contains the Solidity implementation of Mangrove as well as deployment scripts and example Solidity offer logics.

# Documentation

If you are looking for the Mangrove developer documentation, the site to go to is [docs.mangrove.exchange](https://docs.mangrove.exchange).

# Use as a foundry dependency

Just `forge install mangrovedao/mangrove-core`.

⚠️ You will not get the usual remapping `mangrove-core/=lib/mangrove-core/src/` (because forge's remapping generation heuristic sees the `preprocessing/lib/` directory and decides to remap to the parent dir). Instead, you will get:

```
mgv_src/=lib/mangrove-core/src/
mgv_lib/=lib/mangrove-core/lib/
mgv_test/=lib/mangrove-core/test/
mgv_script/=lib/mangrove-core/script/
```

# Installation

First, clone the repo and install the prerequisites for the monorepo described in the root [README.md](../../README.md).

Next, run the following commands:

```shell
$ yarn install   # Sets up Mangrove monorepo and install dependencies
$ yarn build     # Compiles Mangrove and offer logics
```

After the initial installation, it is sufficient to run `yarn build` after updating the clone - this will also run `yarn install`.

# Foundry and its use in this package

This package relies heavily on the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) development framework for Ethereum. It includes an [EVM interpreter](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) with special hooks for

- interpreting `console.log`-type statements
- displaying Solidity stack traces on reverts.

For example, you can use `console.log` in contracts for debugging; those logs survive transaction revert. More in [Foundry's](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/console-log?highlight=console#console-logging). Example:

```
string memory s = "Hello";
uint n = 31;
console.log("Message %s number %d",s,d);
```

# Tests

To run all tests in the package, just run `yarn test`.

This package contains a comprehensive test suite for Mangrove, implemented in Solidity using [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html).

The tests are located in [./test](./test).

Refer to the documentation of [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html) for details on how tests are structured and options for running it.

# Deploying on Mangrove

Mangrove uses `forge script`

[`forge script <scriptName>`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script) executes an arbitrary smart contract function locally. Then, any CALLs executed therein and preceded by the cheatcode [`vm.broadcast()`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/broadcast) can be broadcast to a remote node by reading a forge-generated `run-*.json` field.

## Generating Mangrove address files

The log of transactions generated by `forge script` gets written to `broadcast/<scriptName>/<chainId>/run-latest.json`. It is an array of low-level transactions info with some additions like newly created contract names.

Mangrove needs to:

- Name its contract (multiple instances of the same contract may be deployed)
- Ignore script names (different scripts are used for different networks)
- Have all its deployed contracts in one place

To do the above, Mangrove adds a layer to `forge script` deployment.

- Deployment scripts should inherit the `Deployer` contract.
- You should call `outputDeployment()` at the end of your scripts.
  - When `outputDeployment()` gets called, a file with all known deployed contracts are written to `addresses/deployed.backup/<network>-latest.json`
- You should set `WRITE_DEPLOY=true` when running scripts that you want to broadcast.
  - When `WRITE_DEPLOY=true`, the contract set is also written to `addresses/deployed/<network>.json`.

(Note that for mumbai, `network=maticmum`)

## Foundry keywords for rpc and verification

We use foundry's [`[rpc_endpoints]`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/rpc#examples) and [`[etherscan]`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/etherscan?highlight=etherscan#etherscan) config sections. If the same key exists in both, you can drop the `--etherscan-api-key` from the commandline arguments. For instance if `mumbai` is defined in both sections, you can say `forge script --fork-url mumbai ... --verify` and any deployed contracts will get verified through etherscan using the `mumbai` API key of the `[etherscan]` section.

(Note: in this context, etherscan can mean "polygonscan" or any block explorer)

## Chain-dependent broadcast with private keys in .env

The `vm.broadcast()` cheatcode implicitly selects a sender for the broadcast transactions: either the default sender, or the address associated to the `--private-key` given in the CLI, or to `--mnemonic` information, etc.

It is tiring to always add `--private-key 0x..` to scripts, especially since the key may be different for each network. The `Deployer` contract has a `broadcast()` function that reads the `<NAME>_PRIVATE_KEY` var off the environment, where `NAME` is the name of the chain you're talking to.

- You should have vars such as `MUMBAI_PRIVATE_KEY` , `POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file. You can use [.env.example](.env.example) as a template.
- You should use `broadcast()` instead of `vm.broadcast()` in scripts. The deployer contract will look for the correct private key, and fallback to the CLI-provided key if none was found.

(Note that for Mumbai, `name=”mumbai”`)

# Generate documentation

The Mangrove Solidity files contain documentation that can be extracted to a nicely formatted and navigable HTML file by running `yarn doc` which will generate a `doc/MgvDoc.html`.

# Configuration

This package uses hierarchical configurations via [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config). The main configuration is in [./config/default.js](./config/default.js) and the other .js files in the same directory specify environment/stage specific overrides. Please refer to the documentation for node-config for details on how the configuration hierarchy is resolved.

It is possible to override parts of the configuration with environment variables. This is controlled by [./config/custom-environment-variables.json](./config/custom-environment-variables.json). The structure of this file mirrors the configuration structure but with names of environment variables in the places where these can override a part of the configuration.

For more information, please refer to the node-config's documentation of this feature: https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables#custom-environment-variables .

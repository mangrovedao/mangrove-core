  /* The function `newOffer` is for market makers only; no match with the existing book is done. A maker specifies how much `inbound_tkn` it `wants` and how much `outbound_tkn` it `gives`.

     It also specify with `gasreq` how much gas should be given when executing their offer.

     `gasprice` indicates an upper bound on the gasprice at which the maker is ready to be penalised if their offer fails. Any value below the Mangrove's internal `gasprice` configuration value will be ignored.

    `gasreq`, together with `gasprice`, will contribute to determining the penalty provision set aside by the Mangrove from the market maker's `balanceOf` balance.

  Offers are always inserted at the correct place in the book. This requires walking through offers to find the correct insertion point. As in [Oasis](https://github.com/daifoundation/maker-otc/blob/f2060c5fe12fe3da71ac98e8f6acc06bca3698f5/src/matching_market.sol#L493), the maker should find the id of an offer close to its own and provide it as `pivotId`.

  An offer cannot be inserted in a closed market, nor when a reentrancy lock for `outbound_tkn`,`inbound_tkn` is on.

  No more than $2^{24}-1$ offers can ever be created for one `outbound_tkn`,`inbound_tkn` pair.

  The actual contents of the function is in `writeOffer`, which is called by both `newOffer` and `updateOffer`.

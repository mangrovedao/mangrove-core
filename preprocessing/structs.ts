/* # Mangrove Summary
   * The Mangrove holds order books for `outbound_tkn`,`inbound_tkn` pairs.
   * Offers are sorted in a doubly linked list.
   * Each offer promises `outbound_tkn` and requests `inbound_tkn`.
   * Each offer has an attached `maker` address.
   * In the normal operation mode (called Mangrove for Maker Mangrove), when an offer is executed, we:
     1. Flashloan some `inbound_tkn` to the offer's `maker`.
     2. Call an arbitrary `execute` function on that address.
     3. Transfer back some `outbound_tkn`.
     4. Call back the `maker` so they can update their offers.
   * There is an inverted operation mode (called InvertedMangrove for Taker Mangrove), the flashloan is reversed (from the maker to the taker).
   * Offer are just promises. They can fail.
   * If an offer fails to transfer the right amount back, the loan is reverted.
   * A penalty mechanism incentivizes keepers to keep the book clean of failing offers.
   * A penalty provision must be posted with each offer.
   * If the offer succeeds, the provision returns to the maker.
   * If the offer fails, the provision is given to the taker as penalty.
   * The penalty should overcompensate for the taker's lost gas.

/* # Preprocessing

The current file (`structs.js`) is used in `MgvStructs.pre.sol` (not shown here) to generate the libraries in `MgvType.pre.sol`. Here is an example of js struct specification and of a generated library:
```
struct_defs = {
  universe: [
    {name: "serialnumber", bits: 16, type: "uint"},
    {name: "hospitable",bits: 8, type:"bool"}
  ]
}
```

The generated file will store all data in a single EVM stack slot (seen as an abstract type `<TypeName>Packed` by Solidity); here is a simplified version:

```
struct UniverseUnpacked {
  uint serialnumber;
  bool hospitable;
}

library Library {
  // use Solidity 0.8* custom types
  type UniversePacked is uint;

  // test word equality
  function eq(UniversePacked,UniversePacked) returns (bool);

  // word <-> struct conversion
  function to_struct(UniversePacked) returns (UniverseUnpacked memory);
  function t_of_struct(UniverseUnpacked memory) returns (UniversePacked);

  // arguments <-> word conversion
  function unpack(UniversePacked) returns (uint serialnumber, bool hospitable);
  function pack(uint serialnumber, bool hospitable) returns(UniversePacked);

  // read and write first property
  function serialnumber(UniversePacked) returns (uint);
  function serialnumber(UniversePacked,uint) returns (UniversePacked);

  // read and write second property
  function hospitable(UniversePacked) returns (bool);
  function hospitable(UniversePacked,bool) returns (UniversePacked);
}
```
Then, in Solidity code, one can write:
```
using Universe for Universe.UniversePacked
UniversePacked uni = Universe.pack(32,false);
uint num = uni.serialnumber();
uni.hospitable(true);
```

       * <a id="structs.js/gasbase"></a>  `offer_gasbase` represents the gas overhead used by processing the offer inside Mangrove + the overhead of initiating an entire order.

    The gas considered 'used' by an offer is the sum of
    * gas consumed during the call to the offer
    * `offer_gasbase`
     
   (There is an inefficiency here. The overhead could be split into an "offer-local overhead" and a "general overhead". That general overhead gas penalty could be spread between all offers executed during an order, or all failing offers. It would still be possible for a cleaner to execute a failing offer alone and make them pay the entire general gas overhead. For the sake of simplicity we keep only one "offer overhead" value.)

   If an offer fails, `gasprice` wei is taken from the
   provision per unit of gas used. `gasprice` should approximate the average gas
   price at offer creation time.

   `offer_gasbase` is _24 bits wide_ -- note that if more room was needed, we could bring it down to 8 bits and have it represent 1k gas increments.

   `offer_gasbase` is also the name of a local Mangrove
   parameters. When an offer is created, their current value is copied from Mangrove local configuration.  The maker does not choose it.

   So, when an offer is created, the maker is asked to provision the
   following amount of wei:
   ```
   (gasreq + offer_gasbase) * gasprice
   ```

    where `offer_gasbase` and `gasprice` are Mangrove's current configuration values (or a higher value for `gasprice` if specified by the maker).


    When an offer fails, the following amount is given to the taker as compensation:
   ```
   (gasused + offer_gasbase) * gasprice
   ```

   where `offer_gasbase` and `gasprice` are Mangrove's current configuration values.  The rest is given back to the maker.

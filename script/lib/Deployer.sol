/* Writes deployments in 2 ways:
   1. In a json file. Easier to write one directly than to parse&transform
   foundry broadcast log files.
   2. In a toy Ethereum Name Service (ENS) instance. Useful for testing when the server & testing script
   are both spawned in-process. Holds additional info on the contracts (whether
   it's a token). In the future, could be either removed (in favor of a
   file-based solution), or expanded (if an onchain addressProvider appears).

   How to use:
   1. Inherit Deployer.
   2. Write a innerRun() function that does all the work and can be called by other scripts.
   3. Write a standalone run() function that will be called by forge script. Call outputDeployment() at the end of run() if you deployed any contract.

   Do not inherit other deployer scripts! Just instantiate them and call their
   .innerRun() function;

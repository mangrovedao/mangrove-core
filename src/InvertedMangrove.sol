     1. The taker gets a list of all makers and loops through them to pay back, or
     2. we call a new taker method "payback" after returning from each maker call, or
     3. we call transferFrom after returning from each maker call

  So :
   1. Would mean accumulating a list of all makers, which would make the market order code too complex
   2. Is OK, but has an extra CALL cost on top of the token transfer, one for each maker. This is unavoidable anyway when calling makerExecute (since the maker must be able to execute arbitrary code at that moment), but we can skip it here.
   3. Is the cheapest, but it has the drawbacks of `transferFrom`: money must end up owned by the taker, and taker needs to `approve` Mangrove

  /*
     `invertedFlashloan` is for the 'arbitrage' mode of operation. It:
     0. Calls the maker's `execute` function. If successful (tokens have been sent to taker):
     2. Runs `taker`'s `execute` function.
     4. Returns the results ofthe operations, with optional makerData to help the maker debug.

     There are two ways to do the flashloan:
     1. balanceOf before/after
     2. run transferFrom ourselves.

     ### balanceOf pros:
       * maker may `transferFrom` another address they control; saves gas compared to Mangrove's `transferFrom`
       * maker does not need to `approve` Mangrove

     ### balanceOf cons
       * if the ERC20 transfer method has a callback to receiver, the method does not work (the receiver can set its balance to 0 during the callback)
       * if the taker is malicious, they can analyze the maker code. If the maker goes on any Mangrove2, they may execute code provided by the taker. This would reduce the taker balance and make the maker fail. So the taker could steal the maker's balance.

    We choose `transferFrom`.

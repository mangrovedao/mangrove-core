/* `MgvCommon` and its descendants describe an orderbook-based exchange ("Mangrove") where market makers *do not have to provision their offer*. See `structs.js` for a longer introduction. In a nutshell: each offer created by a maker specifies an address (`maker`) to call upon offer execution by a taker. In the normal mode of operation, Mangrove transfers the amount to be paid by the taker to the maker, calls the maker, attempts to transfer the amount promised by the maker to the taker, and reverts if it cannot.

   There is one Mangrove contract that manages all tradeable offerLists. This reduces deployment costs for new offerLists and lets market makers have all their provision for all offerLists in the same place.

   The interaction map between the different actors is as follows:
   <img src="./contactMap.png" width="190%"></img>

   The sequence diagram of a market order is as follows:
   <img src="./sequenceChart.png" width="190%"></img>

   There is a secondary mode of operation in which the _maker_ flashloans the sold amount to the taker.

   The Mangrove contract is `abstract` and accomodates both modes. Two contracts, `Mangrove` and `InvertedMangrove` inherit from it, one per mode of operation.

   The contract structure is as follows:

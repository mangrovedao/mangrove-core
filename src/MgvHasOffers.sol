  /* When an offer is deleted, it is marked as such by setting `gives` to 0. Note that provision accounting in Mangrove aims to minimize writes. Each maker `fund`s Mangrove to increase its balance. When an offer is created/updated, we compute how much should be reserved to pay for possible penalties. That amount can always be recomputed with `offerDetail.gasprice * (offerDetail.gasreq + offerDetail.offer_gasbase)`. The balance is updated to reflect the remaining available ethers.

     Now, when an offer is deleted, the offer can stay provisioned, or be `deprovision`ed. In the latter case, we set `gasprice` to 0, which induces a provision of 0. All code calling `dirtyDeleteOffer` with `deprovision` set to `true` must be careful to correctly account for where that provision is going (back to the maker's `balanceOf`, or sent to a taker as compensation). */

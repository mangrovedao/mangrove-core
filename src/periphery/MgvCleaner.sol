/* The purpose of the Cleaner contract is to execute failing offers and collect
 * their associated bounty. It takes an array of offers with same definition as
 * `Mangrove.snipes` and expects them all to fail or not execute. */

/* How to use:
   1) Ensure *your* address approved Mangrove for the token you will provide to the offer (`inbound_tkn`).
   2) Run `collect` on the offers that you detected were failing.

   You can adjust takerWants/takerGives and gasreq as needed.

   Note: in the current version you do not need to set MgvCleaner's allowance in Mangrove.
   TODO: add `collectWith` with an additional `taker` argument.

/* The purpose of the Cleaner contract is to execute failing offers and collect
 * their associated bounty. It takes an array of offers with same definition as
 * `Mangrove.snipes` and expects them all to fail or not execute. */

/* How to use:
   1) Ensure *your* address approved Mangrove for the token you will provide to the offer (`inbound_tkn`).
   2) Run `collect` on the offers that you detected were failing.

   You can adjust takerWants/takerGives and gasreq as needed.

   Note: in the current version you do not need to set MgvCleaner's allowance in Mangrove. */

   * NB This impersonation trick only works for sniping of failing offers. Mangrove checks whether `msg.sender` is approved to send orders/snipes for the impersonated taker and reverts if it isn't the case. That check just happens `after` the order has completed and if all taken offers failed, no actual `inbound_tkn` funds were used and the check succeeds, because `msg.sender` is approved for 0 `inbound_tkn`s.

# Audit trail

The following changes have been introduced along with smaller refactoring and comments:
* IOfferLogic, MangroveOffer and downstream contracts have had the reserve concept simplified
* IOfferLogic, Forwarder's retractOffer has been made internal and explicitly exposed on MangroveOrder
* TransferLib has new functions for transferring multiple tokens in one go
* Direct is used by the Kandel strat.

The Kandel strat itself introduces the following building blocks:
* Kandel: The direct Kandel contract without a router which utilizes the other building blocks.
* AaveKandel: The AavePooledRouter version of the Kandel contract
* KandelSeeder: A contract to do permissionless deploy the Kandel and AaveKandel contracts and bind to a shared router
* AbstractKandel: Core abstract functions offered by Kandel strats
* GeometricKandel: Implements the geometric price progression used in the Kandel strat without storing the actual prices
* CoreKandel: Implements the core of the Kandel strat which updates a dual offer whenever an offer is taken, but is agnostic to the actual price distribution.
* TradesBaseQuotePair: Implements helper functions for trading a base, quote pair of tokens using bid and ask terminology.
* HasIndexedBidsAndAsks: Implements the ability to have a [0..length] indexed set of offers on Mangrove for both bids and asks
* DirectWithBidsAndAskDistribution: Adorns the Direct strat with indexed bids and asks and allows the offers to be populated according to a given base and quote distribution.
* AavePooledRouter: a new type of router able to deposit and withdraw funds on AAVE v3.
* AaveV3Lender: a module that implements AAVE v3 interaction capacities.
